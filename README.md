<b>Introduction</b>
For this piece I wanted to investigate the results of relinquishing control of musical parameters to a chaotic modulation source. My main influences for this piece were Iannis Xenakis’ graphical composition system UPIC, and the idea of an ‘Eternal Music’ hypothesised by La Monte Young.

<b>Initial Idea</b>

I was drawn to the idea of using chaos as when one graphs the output of any defining equations for a chaotic map, it is often the case that sinuous curves, slowly evolving patterns, and basins of attraction (grouping of values around a particular number) are present, characteristics that I believed would sound interesting when sonified. Another important aspect of chaotic maps to note is that they are generated by a feed-back process. That is, the output of one iteration becomes the input for the next, meaning after I have designed the system and implemented rules for mapping it to musical parameters, the system will grow and run itself without intervention. This also means that the bulk of the composing is done in real-time; as the piece is being played. Therefore the final recording of the Disklavier part is a fragment in time which I decided to record, but theoretically the piece could continue to play and generate musical data for an extremely long time without repeating itself. However the results would sound similar as I have constrained the values to a set range defined by myself.

<b>Implementation</b>

To realise these ideas I created a patch on the software Max MSP (Appendix B) containing the defining equations for the Tinkerbell (fig.2) and Dejong Maps (fig.1), chosen for the simplicity of their equations and the complexity of their output when graphed. With this patch I have control over the input values to the equations, meaning I also have a certain degree of control over the general form the output will take. The patch is initiated by one button after which the various processes begin, the rate of execution being controlled by a feedback process. The rules of how the output values are utilised in the composition are made explicit in Appendix A. 
The output values from the equations are scaled to fit within a certain range, chosen because I thought they sounded the most musical whilst leaving the chaotic patterns audible and avoiding any sense of tonality. The values are then converted to MIDI data. I use a Disklavier to receive this MIDI data and play it. The score for the Disklavier part is the compressed copy code of the Max MSP patch, meaning that when this code is run in Max MSP, it will generate all the information needed for a Disklavier to play the piece.
